<h3>History of Tattoo : </h3>

<p>
  Tattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified
   preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of 
   possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe.<br/>
   Ancient Siberian nomads, Indigenous Polynesians, Nubians, Native South Americans and Greeks all used tattoos—and 
   for a variety of reasons to protect from evil; declare love; signify status or religious beliefs; 
   as adornments and even forms of punishment.,<br>
   Charles Darwin wrote, “No country in the world that did not practice tattooing or some other form of permanent body decoration.”
